# To do

A simple list of things to do, and to help me keep track of what I'm doing and going to do next.

## Todo

### Admin

- Show how the quest looks like for the team
- Add warning icons to missing fields
- Ability to remove a hint
- When looking at a quest, show the hints that have been revealed and by which team.
- Add a nice overview of the game, what quest they are on (with a link to the quest)
      And which hints they have revealed.
- Add/Remove minutes to the end time after it has been started
- See teams bound to a season and ability to delete them, for testing purposes

### UI/UX

- Use Tailwind CSS instead of styled components

### Chat

- Check how to add voice chat to the game

### General improvements

- Use Firebase for storage to automatically load updates instead of polling

### Game

- When a hint has 0 points, it is treated as non-existent and the team can't reveal it.
- First team to complete the game gets a bonus. This depends on the total number of players
